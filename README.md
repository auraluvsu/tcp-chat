<h1 align="center">TCP-based Chat Service</h1>
<h4 align="center">This is my Chat service using a tcp connection to send messages into a chatroom using a GUI interface with text boxes and real-time messaging.<br>
The program will open using a seperate window and will automatically prompt you to create a username and password, which will then be hashed and stored in a MySQL database.<br>
After this the user will be connected to the chatroom of their choice.
